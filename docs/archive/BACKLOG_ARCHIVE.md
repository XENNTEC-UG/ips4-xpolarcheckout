# X Polar Checkout Archive Backlog

This archive preserves completed migration checkpoints that no longer belong in active backlog tracking.

## Archived Completion Notes

- Baseline app rename and package cleanup completed.
- Namespace and gateway class normalization completed.
- Setup metadata simplification and install-path recovery completed.
- Signature validation hardening and forensic logging baseline completed.
- Documentation structure aligned to component contract.

## Archive Intent

- Keep active work in `docs/BACKLOG.md`.
- Keep shipped outcomes in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep detailed implementation sequencing in `docs/POLAR_GATEWAY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

This file is intentionally concise and historical only.
